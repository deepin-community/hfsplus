<sect> NAME<p>
<bf>hfsp</bf> <bf>hfsplus</bf> - Collection of tools to acces
    HFS+ volumes.

<sect> DESCRIPTION<p>
The hfsplus collection cotains tools to read and display the files
found on an HFS+ formatted volume. HFS+ is the volume format
intodruced by Apple Computer inc. around MacOS 8. The HFS+ format
uses a better approach to acces large volumes and allows files
with a size up to 2^64 bytes. In Addition filenames are saved 
as two-byte unicode with a length upto 255 (unicode) characters.
</p><p>
In contrast to its sucessor, the hfs-tools hfsplus does not use
the volume/directory/file/ syntax using ':' as delimiter but
uses the standard unix '/', '..' and '.' notation. Since this
concept is not fully supported my HFS+ not all combinations
will be understood.

<sect> EXAMPLES<p>
This example mounts my main HFS+ volume, shows some files and copies
one to the linux side:
<tscreen><verb>
> hpmount /dev/hda13
> hpls
Apple Extras     Desktop Folder   MP3              Systemordner
Benutzer         Develop          Programme        Temporary Items
Bibel            Dokumente        Spiele           VM Storage
> hpcd Develop
> hpcd Test
> hppwd
/Aida/Develop/Test
hpcopy -t Test.cp .
> hpumount
</verb></tscreen>

<sect> FILES<p>
<bf>$HOME/.hfsplusvolume</bf>
This file is created by hpmount and removed by hpunmount. It contains
the volume name and the current directory id.

<sect> BUGS<p>
There are some bugs related to uniocde handling and the large file
sizes not supported by some older formats (binhex, macbinary).
See the developer documenatation for details
