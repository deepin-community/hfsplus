  The hfsplus collection cotains tools to read and display the files
  found on an HFS+ formatted volume. HFS+ is the volume format
  intodruced by Apple Computer inc. around MacOS 8. The HFS+ format uses
  a better approach to acces large volumes and allows files with a size
  up to 2^64 bytes. In Addition filenames are saved as two-byte unicode
  with a length upto 255 (unicode) characters.

  In contrast to its sucessor, the hfs-tools hfsplus does not use the
  volume/directory/file/ syntax using ':' as delimiter but uses the
  standard unix '/', '..' and '.' notation. Since this concept is not
  fully supported my HFS+ not all combinations will be understood.

  This example mounts my main HFS+ volume shows some files and copies
  one to the linux side:


       > hpmount /dev/hda13
       > hpls
       Apple Extras     Desktop Folder   MP3              Systemordner
       Benutzer         Develop          Programme        Temporary Items
       Bibel            Dokumente        Spiele           VM Storage
       > hpcd Develop
       > hpcd Test
       > hppwd
       /Aida/Develop/Test
       hpcopy -t Test.cp .
       > hpumount

  $$HHOOMMEE//..hhffsspplluussvvoolluummee This file is created by hpmount and removed by
  hpunmount. It contains the volume name and the current directory id.

  There are some bugs related to uniocde handling and the large file
  sizes not supported by some older formats (binhex, macbinary).  See
  the developer documenatation for details
