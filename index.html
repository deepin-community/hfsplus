<h3> Current Status </h3>
<p>
<b>Klaus Halfmann</b><br />
I decided to recreate the parts of the original hfsutils and
keep theire names but remame "hfs" to "hfsp" reso. "h" to "hp" 
wherever needed.
I started working on libhfsp. Im used to OO-Programming, so
I recreated the code with objects in mind. See documenation
for <a href="doc/libhfsp.html">libhfsp</a>.
</p><p>
The libhfsp part works for (most) readonly purposes. Im currently
working on user-useable tools like hpmount hpcd and hpls.
</p><p>
<b>Other...</b><br />
Ask me (Klaus Hafmann &lt;klaus.halfmann@t-online.de&gt; where you might help.
