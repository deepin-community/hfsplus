hfsplus (1.0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Architecture changed from powerpc to any (closes: Bug#95337).  I don't
    see how the package should be useful on anything but PowerPC hardware,
    given that it only reads HFS+ volumes which still need to be created
    and populated by MacOS.  But you never know ...

 -- Jens Schmalzing <jensen@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Apr 2001 09:44:40 +0200
