Hello Brad,

I think I have another bit of progress now.
    -> All record_read_... methods are ok
    -> All record__print_... methods are ok.
    -> I started the first attempts for binary search
       (in one node)
I now understand why record_treads are neede, the
work like the '.' nodes in unix. But Im unsure
what the file_threads are neede for, perphaps
for the (yet unused) attributes fork ?

Ill Test the binary search etc and then will look ahead to support
the INDX nodes. 

Did you ever have a look at the hfsutils ?. As soon as an
ls is possible Id like to copy the hfsmount and hfsls commands
and transform them into hfspmount and hfspls. In case you
want to help you might start here ...

Greetings
	Klaus Halfmann (aka Hasi)
