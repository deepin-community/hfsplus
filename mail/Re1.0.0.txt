Thanks to all who responded. Here is some more info ...

I uploaded a binary and a source distribution to
    
    ftp://penguinppc.org/pub/hfsplus/

Thanks to flar I found a missing file in the cvs-repository
Here the commands to access the CVS:
    
export CVSROOT=":pserver:anonymous@partner.suse.de:/usr/local/hfsplus"
cvs login
[password hfsplus]
cvs co hfsplus
cd hfsplus/libhfsp
make -f Makefile.cvs
make  

I intend to work for one or two month and fix the bugs I already
found. After that Ill create a new Distribution. This might change
when someone starts helping me...

I currently fix bugs related to wildcard matching etc. I assume
these will keep me busy for a while. After that I think Ill redesing
my object approach. The btree(s) will become part of the volume
and not be visible to the "outside" any more. The redsign will
include a cache. For everything else keep an eye on the top-level
index.html. Ill try to be somewhat current there :)

Admitted the _checking_ of an HFS+ volume is realtivly easy, I
have quite a bit of respect for the task of fixing it. Just
be patient :)
