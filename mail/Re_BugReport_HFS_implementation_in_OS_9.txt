Betreff: Re: BugReport HFS+ implementation in OS 9

Klaus, this is the latest:

-----------------
11/7/00 6:39 PM Bill xxxx:
I am not sure I understand what the developer is talking about. We don't maintain a leaf node count, only a leaf record count? The BTree Header Record (BTHeaderRec, defined in HFSVolumes.h) maintains a count of the number of records contained in the leaf nodes of the tree (BTHeaderRec->leafRecords), as well as the total number of nodes allocated to the BTree file (BTHeaderRec->totalNodes), and the number of free nodes (BTHeaderRec->totalNodes). The leaf record count in the BTHeaderRec was getting out of synch in earlier version of MacOS X but I haven't seen that since Beta.

Can we get the developer to clarify this?
----------------


Thanks,
Peter
