Ahrg, I assumed those offsets at the end of the Catalog _fork_
not at the end of the Catalog _record_ (Ok, I can throw away some
of my code now :). Hmm I miss some start of the Btree map recod
let me study this stupid technote again ... Ok I think I had
a deep mistunderstanding of the hierarchy of structures. As
I understdand the hierarchy now as follows:

Volume (contains some predefined forks)
    Nodes (cocantenated via next/prev)
	BTrees (spanning over Nodes)
	    (Btree-)records (files/folders)

    Forks of files (data / rsrc) as found in btrees.
    Extends file
	Btree
	    extends records (keyed by parent / file cnid)

(The technote really lacks an explanantion like this ...)

The imposes, that one can do a binary search on those keys,
fine.

Ill try to force MacOS into creating some extends and then 
will implement it ...

Oh well, I earn my money by doing Java programming on NT and
(starting soon) AS400 (Yes you can do Java on those boxes :-)
(Hm, but since they use PowerPC theyd bette'r run ppcLinux :-( )

Well, Ill try this messanger than. In case this might fail 
ill 'ping' you at your email adress. I'd suggest we use irc
this way eventually attracting some people to join us ...

I think you are right here. Now since I found my basic mistakes
I can go ahead and implement and test more utility functions.
I will restructuree it in a away that the record will be "below"
the btree.

Thanks for you comments, it really pushed me foreward to discuss
things with someone.
