Does SuSE use rpms?  I thought it was specific to RedHat/linuxppc.com.

I attached the source rpm.  This includes the source tar (you don't
need this obviously, but it's part of the package :), the patch file
and the rpm spec file.

To build the binary rpm from the source rpm do:

  rpm --rebuild hfsplusutils-1.0.1-1.src.rpm

This will leave the binary rpm in 

 /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/ppc/hfsplusutils-1.0.1-1.ppc.rpm

The binary rpm is what you would usually distribute.  I made the rpm
to install your executables in /usr/bin and libs in /usr/lib, instead
of /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib.  I was trying to make it as
close as possible to the hfsutils rpm.  

If you just want to look at the contents of the source rpm, do:

 rpm -i hfsplusutils-1.0.1-1.src.rpm

The spec will be installed in /usr/src/redhat/SPECS and the source tar
and the patch will be installed in /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES.
