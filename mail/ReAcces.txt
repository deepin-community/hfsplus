Well, I don't know if this is your problem, but your comments show
a misunderstanding of the wrapper data. The data you are calling
embede is not the end of the embedded filesystem as stated in your
comments. It's the number of allocation blocks used by the embedded
filesystem.

The way I interpret the code that's currently in CVS, maxbloks
will point to the first block that isn't in the HFS+ data.
This is just my interpretation at first glance. I could be wrong...

Well, unless you know where the end of the volume is, you can't
find the backup of the volume header, since its location is
relative to the end of the filesystem.
