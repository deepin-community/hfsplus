This package is a set of tools that allow acces to HFS+ fomatted
volumes. HFS+ is a modernized version of Apple Computers HFS 
Filesystem. In addition in contains the library "libhfsp" which
you may use for your own experiments, all the tools are based
on this library. (A bit of understanding is still needed however).
